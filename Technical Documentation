The RemindMe application has been developed using Python3 for the backend and HTML5/CSS3 for the front end. First the user is directed to the login page where they enter their username and email. The program checks whether the user exists in the JSON file or not. The JSON file consists of the list of usernames and the different subscription data. If they exist the user will be redirected to the main page and the details of their subscription such as Subscription name, type, start date, end date and remaining days in the subscription will be displayed. Otherwise, the username, email and service data are appended to the file. The user has an option to add more subscriptions by clicking on the New Subscription button. The new subscription is appended to the JSON file. The main page has three tabs for Subscriptions, Offers and discounts.
