# RemindMe-App---Finhack-Project-Hackstreet-Boys-

The method of payment in exchange for services has changed a lot over time. Now a lot of payments that are done by physical means/by direct method is replaced by online payments. A person would be making a lot of payments for different services via the internet and itâ€™s quite natural that a person could forget about their payment deadlines. So, reminding/notifying them about their payments have become a need of the hour. This type of application is really important for people who tend to forget things quickly. The RemindMe application has been developed using Python3 for the backend and HTML5/CSS3 for the front end. The RemindMe application keeps you updated with the ongoing discounts/offers for different subscription types. Users can find out when their payments are due or when the deadlines are nearing. Users can also check the expired plans, pending payments and a list of the last date of payment for different subscriptions and choose whether to renew it or not. It would be helpful for people in the future as it will help them make their payments on time so that they can use the services without disruptions. Since there has been a huge hike in the online payment method due to the current covid situation this will be of great application for people who are starting out online payments.
